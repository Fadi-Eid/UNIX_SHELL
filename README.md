# UNIX_SHELL
This is an implementation of a Linux shell that runs in a native shell.

This shell can be optimized further and can be optimzed acoording to someone's need.

This is a project that I created after completing the 3rd chapter of the book OS Concepts 10th Edition

I used Unix system calls such as fork(), execvp(), waitpid(), dup2() and pipe().

This shell supports history (last command execution) using "!!"
input and output redirection using ">" and "<"
the pipe operator |

Further edits should be made for a cleaner formatting, better error checking, 
and memory management.
